### GET EMAILS  


Very basic one page that can get labels, list of email ids and an email based on one of those ids. 



#### Requirements  
Go to https://console.developers.google.com and create an `api key` and `client` credentials   
Create a `config.js` file in the same folder as `index.html` with the format:  

```javascript  
var config = {
  "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  "API_KEY": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx",
}  
```  

Then start a local server and visit localhost:3000
